# RuleGraph
my master degree project (Association rule visualization)

-Use angular framework
-There're many duplicated code(more than 10 code location to fix). So i will fix it later.
-Html files are horrible. Pray for god before watch it!
-No grunt. No unit test. No nodeJs.
-Contain Google API code.
-Contain d3 library.(credit https://d3js.org/(created by Mike bostock))

This project use only 3 day to implement and it's used only one time. So it may seem bad and unattractive.
